## Load data
```{r load}
med_trans <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv") 
```

# Question 1
```{r}
med_trans %>%
  unnest_tokens(token, medical_specialty, token = "sentences") %>%
  count(token) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(token, n)))+
  geom_col()
```
